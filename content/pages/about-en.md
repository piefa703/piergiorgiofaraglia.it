software engineering.

I have gained work experience both in Italy (mainly Rome) that
abroad (Sweden, UK). Over the years I have come across in a
multitude of software projects that have enabled me to acquire
experience in more areas in computer science.

Since 2010 I deal mainly with design and development of web portals
both as a freelancer or as an employee of the company. I worked for large
portals such Immobiliare.it comparing them daily with large volumes
of users.

The solutions we propose are based on open-source software platforms that
allow a reduction of licensing costs for the end customer.
